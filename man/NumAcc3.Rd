Dataset of 1001 8-digit points
}
\details{
This generated/fabricated dataset consists of 1001 8-digit floating-point
    values: a single 1000000.2, followed by 500 pairings of 1000000.1 and
    1000000.3. By construction, this data set has sample mean = 1000000.2
    (exact); sample standard deviation = .1 (exact); and sample autocorrelation
    coef. = -0.999 (exact). The construction was carried out based on
    considerations described by Simon, Stephen D. and Lesage, James P. (1989):
    Assessing the Accuracy of ANOVA Caluclations in Statistical Software",
    Computational Statistics \& data Analysis, 8, pp. 325-332.
